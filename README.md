# Linear minimum-variance approximants for noisy data

Subdivision schemes are efficient tools to generate functions (such as curves) from sample data. Subdivision rules that are optimal for noisy data are derived in [1].

This repository includes:
1. MATLAB implementation of the linear minimum-variance approximants for noisy data
2. Test files, reproducing the numerical results in [1].
